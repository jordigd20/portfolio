## Objective

The main objective of this project was to develop an e-commerce from scratch, using technologies in the backend that I had not used before such as NestJS, Prisma and PostgreSQL. In addition, Stripe has also been used for the management of user payments.

Regarding the frontend part, Angular v16.0 and TailwindCSS have been used to develop the user interface.

## Main features

- **User management**: Users can create an account and access it to manage their personal data, orders and wishlist.
- **Order management**: Users can place orders for books and manage them from their account.
- **Book management**: Users can see all the books available in the store and add them to their wishlist to buy them later.
- **Payment management**: Users can pay for their orders using Stripe.
- **Rating management**: Users can rate the books they have purchased.
