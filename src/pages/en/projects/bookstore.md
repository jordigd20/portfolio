## Objective

The main objective of this project was to develop an e-commerce from scratch, using technologies in the backend that I had not used before such as NestJS, Prisma and PostgreSQL. In addition, Stripe has also been used for the management of user payments.

Regarding the frontend part, Angular v16.0 and TailwindCSS have been used to develop the user interface.
